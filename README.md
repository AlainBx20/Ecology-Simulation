Ecosystem Simulation with AI Agent
This project simulates an ecosystem where an AI agent interacts with plants, obstacles, and grows or shrinks in size based on its actions. The agent's goal is to eat plants (represented by green squares) while avoiding obstacles (represented by red squares). As the agent eats plants, it grows in size, but if it hits an obstacle, it shrinks. The environment is displayed in a grid, and the agent moves around randomly. The project uses JavaScript and HTML5 canvas for the simulation.

Features
Agent Movement: The agent moves randomly across the grid (up, down, left, right).
Plant Interaction: The agent gains size by "eating" plants (green squares).
Obstacle Interaction: The agent loses size when it hits obstacles (red squares).
Environment Reset: The ability to reset the environment and agent to their initial states.
Dynamic Growth and Shrinking: The agent grows when it eats plants and shrinks when it hits obstacles.
Technologies Used
HTML5: For rendering the grid and the agent on the canvas.
CSS: For styling the user interface and the simulation.
JavaScript: For the simulation logic, agent movement, and interaction with the environment.
How to Run
Clone the repository:

to clone :
git clone https://github.com/AlainBx20/Ecology-Simulation.git

Navigate to the index.html file in your browser to view the simulation.
Usage
Start Simulation: Click the "Start Simulation" button to begin the agent's movements. The agent will start interacting with the environment, eating plants and avoiding obstacles.
Reset Environment: Click the "Reset Environment" button to reset the environment and the agent's state.
